# MovieAPP

## Overview

The Movieic is an Android application that provides detailed information about movies. Using modern Android development practices, this app is built with MVVM architecture, Coroutines for asynchronous operations, Paging3 for efficient data handling, Room for local storage, Retrofit for network requests, and Dagger Hilt for dependency injection.

## Features

- Movie Information: View detailed information about movies, including synopsis, release date, and genre.
- Cast Details: See the cast and crew involved in each movie.
- Trailers: Watch trailers for movies directly within the app.
- Bookmarked Movies: Save and manage a list of favorite movies for quick access.
- Offline Storage: Cache movie information for offline access, allowing users to view movie details without an active internet connection.

- Coroutines: For managing asynchronous tasks and background operations.
- Paging3: For efficient and smooth paging of large datasets.
- Room: For local database management and caching.
- Retrofit: For making network requests and handling API interactions.
- Glide: For efficient image loading and caching.
- Dagger Hilt: For dependency injection and managing app components.
